      <p class="mb-4"><strong>A - Alone:</strong> Your baby should sleep alone in their own safe sleep space, without parents, siblings, or pets.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>B - Back:</strong> Always place your baby on their back to sleep for every sleep, including naps. This is the single most effective action you can take to lower your baby's risk of SIDS.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>C - Crib:</strong> Use a safety-approved crib, bassinet, or play yard with a firm, flat mattress and a fitted sheet. Keep the crib free of blankets, pillows, bumper pads, stuffed animals, and other soft items.</p>
      <p>Following these guidelines is the most effective way to provide a safe sleep environment for your baby and reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Do Toddlers Have Tantrums?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Tantrums are often a sign that your child is overwhelmed by big emotions. Their language skills are still developing, so they can't always express feelings like frustration, anger, or disappointment with words. This frustration can boil over into a tantrum.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How to Respond:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Stay Calm:</strong> Your calm presence is reassuring, even if they don't show it.</li>
        <li><strong>Acknowledge their Feelings:</strong> Use simple words. "I know you're very upset because you wanted that toy."</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure Safety:</strong> If they are hitting or kicking, move them to a safe space away from anything that could harm them.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't Reason During the Storm:</strong> Keep it brief. Don't try to reason or lecture during the tantrum.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect After:</strong> Once they've calmed down, offer a hug and talk simply about what happened.</li>

      <p class="mb-4">Tummy time is supervised playtime that your baby spends on their stomach while awake. It's essential for helping them build strength in their neck, shoulder, and back muscles. This strength is the foundation for motor skills like rolling over, sitting up, and crawling.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">How to Get Started:</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Start Early:</strong> You can begin tummy time the day you bring your baby home from the hospital.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it Short:</strong> Start with just 2-3 minutes at a time, a few times a day. Gradually increase the duration as your baby gets stronger.</li>
        <li><strong>Make it Fun:</strong> Get down on their level, talk to them, sing songs, or use colorful toys to keep them engaged.</li>
        <li><strong>Try Different Positions:</strong> You can also do tummy time by laying your baby on your chest or lap.</li>

      <p class="mb-4">The Government of India offers several schemes to ensure the well-being of mothers and children. Here are two of the most important ones:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">PMMVY is a maternity benefit program. Eligible pregnant and lactating mothers receive a cash incentive of <strong>â‚¹5,000</strong> in three installments for the first live birth. This is to provide partial wage compensation and ensure proper nutrition.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">JSY is a safe motherhood intervention aimed at reducing maternal and neonatal mortality by promoting institutional delivery (giving birth in a hospital or health centre). Under JSY, eligible pregnant women are entitled to cash assistance and transport support for delivering in a government or accredited private health facility.</p>
      
      <p class="mt-6 font-semibold">To avail these benefits, you must register your pregnancy at the nearest Anganwadi Centre (AWC) or an approved Health facility.</p>
